# Hangman Console Game

Welcome to the Hangman Console Game! This application allows you to play the classic word-guessing game right in your console. It's built using an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach and incorporates ArrayLists, HashMaps, file reading, and content parsing.

## How to Play

1. You will be presented with a hidden word, and your goal is to guess it letter by letter, with the help of the definition.
2. Enter a letter and press Enter(note, that only first letter matter). 
3. If the letter is part of the hidden word, it will be revealed; otherwise, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn.
4. Keep guessing letters until you either guess the entire word or the hangman is fully drawn.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Approach:** The application is designed using OOP principles for clear code structure and maintainability.
- **ArrayList Usage:** ArrayLists are used to manage the state of the guessed word and hangman figure.
- **HashMap Implementation:** A HashMap is employed to store words and their definitions.
- **File Reading:** The application reads words and definitions from a file for an extensive word bank.
- **Content Parsing:** The file content is parsed to extract words and their meanings for the game.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** The game dynamically responds to your input, updating the word, hangman figure, and score.
